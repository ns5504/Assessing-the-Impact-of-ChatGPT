# Assessing-the-Impact-of-ChatGPT

ChatGPT, introduced by OpenAI in November 2022, has rapidly transformed the use of AI in education. This study analyzes 2,086 Reddit posts from educational subreddits to understand how students, educators, and professionals perceive its impact on teaching, learning, and engagement. Using sentiment analysis (VADER, BERT, GPT) and topic modeling (LDA, CorEx, BERTopic), we identified a range of reactionsâ€”from enthusiasm about its benefits to concerns over ethics and misuse. A validation set of 200 posts was annotated by undergraduates using refined guidelines, and GPT-3.5/GPT-4 models with reasoning outperformed human annotations. Findings show that while ChatGPT offers opportunities to support education, it also raises issues like plagiarism, loss of critical thinking, and unequal access. Educators report difficulty in evaluating student learning due to AI use. The study highlights the urgent need for responsible AI integration, ethical standards, and further research to ensure AI enhances education without compromising its integrity
